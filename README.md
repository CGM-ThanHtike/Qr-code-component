## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**"Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge."**

- This is my third challenge. Implemented with pure html css.
- It's a pretty simple challenge, however, I've learnt how to make a beautiful QR code component.
- I just learnt about relative units (rem and em) these days and implement those in this challenge.
- I make the font and card width to be relative even with the browser font size. (if you adjust the browser font size, the card will become smaller or larger)

## Overview

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## My process

- First I analyze the deisgn
- Thinking the easiest way for layout like using flex box and grid
- As it's a simple layout, there's not so much stress.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt about rem units to make the fonts relative and even the card width.
